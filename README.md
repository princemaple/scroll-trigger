> Trigger actions on scroll to a point

This module is based on [img-src-ondemand][1], the other module that I wrote
some time ago to delay image loading to only when they appear on screen.
Recently, I wanted to write a new infinite scroll library to replace the use of
[ngInfiniteScroll][2] which I don't like so much. Reason being it requires you
to pass a selector or a selector function as setup so the service can find the
infinite scroll container. This doesn't work well if the container is somewhere
in a route view. The container should be able to reach the service, so that
doesn't matter where it's put, it can work. After some thought, I realized that
the logic it requires here is already written in my previous library. Now, I
extracted the logic and generalized it, so it can be used in a much wider range.

### Demo
Some demos. Scroll down slowly.

- `trigger-persist`: do not remove the trigger (event listener) after it has been triggered
- `trigger-active`: conditionally check screen position
- `scroll-container`: instead of listening on `window`, listen on a specific container
- `scroll-trigger-id`: manually assign a unique identifier

#### Available configuration
- `offset`: gives you adjustable space
